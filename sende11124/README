Thank you for installing MPEC!
The copyright notice and disclaimers are given in the top of the file start.f in the source directory.

The distribution package consists of the follow files:

README       - this file
data.tar     - basis set and other data for MPEC 
lib.tar      - math library directory
mpeclogo.pdf - MPEC logo
mpecman.pdf  - user manual for MPEC
mfileh2.x    - script to make MPEC
source.tar   - MPEC source code directory
test.tar     - MPEC test run directory

To install MPEC, edit mfileh2.x to set the compilers, etc to create MPEC.
Then run using the Borne shell, i.e. sh mfileh2.x.

I include as examples creating MPEC on my laptop computer which has open-mpi installed on it and
creating MPEC on the NAS facility parallel computers. Hopefully your situation will be similar to
one of these two examples.

A script named .prempec is created in the installers home directory. It must be executed in every
MPEC job script, as shown as the sample inputs. The sample inputs must be run using the Borne shell,
i.e. sh runccontract.sample.

Some of the MPEC routines are sufficiently complex that compiliers I have access to do not compile
them properly with optimization turned on. Those routines use $optno as their optimazation flag while
then other routines use $opt as their optimzation flag. Make sure to set both variables!

One has multiple options in the creation of MPEC:

One can use basic MPI commands (DDI-1) or MPI-4 commands (DDI-4) by setting the shell variable ddi to
1 (for DDI-1) and something else otherwise. For fewer than ~25 processors, use MPI-4.

One can use a system math library or a library created from the files in lib.tar: set the shell
variable lib to 0 for the former choice and non-zero otherwise.
These library files are available under the modified BSD license, which is given at the end of this
document.

One can use the matrix multiply routine dgemm from the library or one can use a special version that
stops in case of an error and writes out where it is called: on the NAS systems the library dgemm
writes out an error message but continues when an error is encountered. Set the shell variable dgemm
to 0 to get the library matrix multiply routine and non-zero to get the special version.

Default values of parameters are set in a series of include files. If you don't like values I use, feel free
to change them. This must be done before compilation.
The include files are in the source directory, and are
cas.par
mrci.par

Most dimensions in the program are allocated by reserving space in one massive array, but there
are some dimensions set by parameter statements. These are mainly used to make input easier, and do not
involve large amounts of memory, so large values are not detrimental.

The size of the massive array is specified by the parameter maxbc in the file common.store.
The current value is 2**31-1, the maximum memory that can be addressed with a signed 4 byte integer.
If this exceeds your harware limitations, that should not be an issue on modern computers unless MPEC
tries to use more memory than you hardware allows. In the latter case, the program will crash with
some sort of system error.

The maximum number of atoms is specified by the parameter ida in the file common.basis

The maximum number of spin/symmetry blocks in the state averaged cas is specified by the
parameter maxst1 in the file common.cas

The maximum number of roots per spin/symmetry block in the state averaged cas is specified
by the parameter maxst2 in the file common.cas.

The maximum number of reference orbitals in the MRCI calculations is specified by the parameter ido
in the file common.mrci.

The maximum number of extra symmetries to generate contraction coefficients in the i^2cMRCI calculations
is specified by the parameter maxxref in the file common.mrci.

The maximum number of distributed arrays is specified by the parameter id in common.mympi.template.

For DDI-1 calculations, the maximum number of processors is specified in by parameter mxcproc in common.mympi.template

Modified BSD license:
Like all software, it is copyrighted. It is not trademarked, but we do ask the following:

    If you modify the source for these routines we ask that you change the name of the routine and comment the changes made to the original.

    We will gladly answer any questions regarding the software. If a modification is done, however, it is the responsibility of the person who
    modified the routine to provide support.
